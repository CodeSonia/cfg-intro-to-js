## What do we mean by logic?
In programming, logic means identifying the similarities and differences of elements to identify how they operate together to perform a specific task. 

It determines the relationship between data - whether they're connected or not, if one is greater than the other, if they match types or cannot be concatenated. 

For example, if you need to write a prgram that needed to calculate the av. set of numbers, you would need to use logic to add the numbers together, and divide them by the total number of numbers, and return the result. **This is where you would understand the relationship between the numbers and how to manipulate them to achieve the desired result.**

To do this, we use **logical and comparison operators**.

This comes into play when we use **conditional statements**.

## What is a condition?
In programming, we create a set of conditions/statements/rules that determine how our code runs. Depending on the conditions, some bits of code might run and others may not.

- **"If" statements**: where if a condition is true it is used to specify execution for a block of code.
- **"Else" statements**: where if the same condition is false, it specifies the execution for a block of code.
- **"Else if** statements**: this specifies a new test if the first condition is false.


We use conditional statements to control the flow of our code. These conditional statements are based on **boolean values** whether something is true or false.

### Logical Operators
- **&& - AND**: returns true if both arguments are either true or false.
- **| | - OR** : In case any of its arguments are true, it returns true, if not, it returns false.
- **! - NOT**: inverses the value upon which it is used.

### Comparison Operators
| Operator | Description | Example | Result |
| ----------- | ----------- |----------- | ----------- |
| == | Equal to | 1 ==1 | true
| === | Equal in value and type | 1 === '1' | false
| != | Not equal to | 1 != 2 | true
| !== | Not equal in value and type | 1 !== '1' | true
| > | Greater than | 1 > 2 | false
|< | Less than | 1 < 2 | true 
| >= | Greater than or equal to | 1 >= 1 | true
| <= | Less than or equal to | 2 <= 1 | false
