// Exercise 2.3 - Letâ€™s say we can only run a small class. Create
// variables for class size (0), maxClassSize (7) and an empty
// classList. Use a while loop to add random students to the
// classList so long as the number of students in the new class is
// less than the maximum size.

const maxClassSize = 7;
const classList = [];

while (classSize < maxClassSize) {
  // generate a random student name

  // remove the selected student from the array to avoid duplicates like the below!
  // students.splice(randomStudent, 1);
  // add new student to the empty array
