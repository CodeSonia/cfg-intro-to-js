## Functions
Function allows us to take snippets of code and store it as a kind of tool, which we can call throughoout the course of our code. 

Functions allow us to:
- Do more with our code
- Carry out tasks faster 
- Reuse different tools with new information

**A function is a reusable block of code** and it can include it's own variables and operations, and has paramters so that you can feed it information to get new information in return. Think of it as input > function > output. 

```
function calcArea(width, height) {
  let result = width * height;
  return result
};

calcArea(4,3);
```
> Difference between parameter and argument:

**The input we give to the function is called a parameter**. It's like a variable that's only meaningfun inside the function. When calling this functions, that's when we declare the value of the parameter, **that's what we call an argument**.
