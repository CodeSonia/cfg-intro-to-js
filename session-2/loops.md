We often need to repeat certain tasks while coding for example, repeating a function x many times, this is the reason why we use loops.

Loops contain parts of code that will repeat based on certain conditions.

There are two main types of loops:

- **FOR**: Used when we know **EXACTLY HOW MANY TIMES** we want a piece of code to run
- **WHILE**: Used when we want to **BREAK THE LOOP WHEN IT MEETS A CONDITION**, not a certain number of times.

Both for loops and while loops rely on some kind of initial index. For a for loop, this will be specified within the loop parameters, whereas a while loop will often take it from an outside variable.

- **WHILE LOOPS** are best used when **SEARCHING** for something.
- **FOR LOOPS** are best for **REPEATING** what you already know.

> NOTE: Remember that while loops will go on as long as the condition is true, so they can potentially become an infinite loop.
